    <font face="Tahoma">Soft skills are a cluster of productive personality traits that characterize one's relationships in a social environment.</font> <font face="Trebuchet"> These skills can include social graces, communication abilities, language skills, personal habits, cognitive or emotional empathy, time management, teamwork and leadership traits.</font> <font face="Verdana"> A definition based on review literature explains soft skills as an umbrella term for skills under three key functional elements:</font> <font face="Helvetica"> people skills, social skills, and personal career attributes.</font>
    <font face="Georgia">The importance of soft skills lies in the fact that they are not restricted to a specific field.</font> <font face="Garamond"> These thinking dispositions consist of a group of abilities that can be used in every aspect of people's lives, without any need to readapt them based on the situation.</font> <font face="Times New Roman">Their ductility helps “people to adapt and behave positively so that they can deal effectively with the challenges of their professional and everyday life”.Soft skills make people flexible in a world which keeps changing.</font>
